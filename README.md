JavaScript arrayMethods using SimpleTest
=======================================
Download the repository and open any of the webpages under the folder 'arrayMethods'. These contain my implementations of each of the native methods available to JavaScript arrays, and the test cases I used to create them. The status of each test (pass/fail) will be logged to the console as soon as the page is loaded.
